As of Monday, 17 April 2020, [**occultist.io**](https://occultist.io/) is now online.

After a four months of development and implementing module and extension systems into Chaos language, we reach
to a point that a dependency manager required to install the modules and extensions.

We named the dependency manager `occultist` because the Chaos language's motto is "Turn chaos into magic!" and
the definition of **occultist** is:

> occultist is a person who believes in the supernatural and the power of magic

Therefore we imagined `occultist` as a person who manages your magical power.

Unlike the popular naming convention, we named the packages as **"spell"** just because to outshine the
other package managers, adding some fun to it and making the name relevant to the context.

You can find the registered spells in [**The Chaos Spell Index**](https://occultist.io/spells).
