### Comments

Commented out lines starts with either `//` or `#`:

```text
kaos> // This is a comment
kaos> # This is a comment too
kaos> print "But this is not" // End of Line(EOL) comment
But this is not
```

You can also write multiline comments with `/*` and `*/`:

```text
/*
This is a
multiline comment
for the function below
*/
void def some_function()
...
```
